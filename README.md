# JavaScript-Projects

These are some small projects I made using JavaScript during my course with the Tech Academy.

<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
This project is a menu used to order pizza of various sizes with a variety of toppings to choose from. The menu takes your choices and calculates how much that pizza would cost (first topping is free!)

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
When playing tic-tac-toe using my project, you play against a computer program created by me. As the human, you go first and then the program chooses a square at random. If it does not contain anything it places it's marker. If the space does contain a marker already however, the program chooses a new random square. The winner is celebrated by a victorious-sounding "Winner".

<h3>Calculator</h3>
A basic 4 function calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply and divide on a classic looking virtual calculator.
